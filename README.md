# Exercise task 1.2
I am using dictionaries as it is the most flexible when it comes to storing different data types
## Data types
- name (string) as it contains a list of letters
- cooking_time (float) as it contains a number that may need to be a decimal 
- ingredients (list) as it needs to contain different types of data

## Why recipe_1 into all_recipes?
Because all recipes is the general index where more recipes will be store, this is just one of the all recipes, which can be updated an modified.
